# pthreadbook-rs
The purpose is to reimplement the examples from the book [Programming with POSIX Threads]() with Rust by using the Rust standard library. Only in situations where the desired functionality is not covered by the standard library the code will use libc to achieve its goal.

## Why?
I like Rust and C (especially in the context of Linux system programming) and want to learn more about multi-threaded programming in Rust and C. That is a nice way to combine all those goals.
